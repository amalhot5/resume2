% At the age of seven (1989) Cies wrote his first lines of code in a \acr{LOGO}-like language on an \acr{MSX} (pre-\acr{PC}).  Two years later he attended a conference on an emerging new technology, the Internet, at the Erasmus University from which he would graduate 16 years later (2000) with a degree in Business Computer Science.

% After being introduced to the open source movement in 1997, he taught himself a variety of skills including system administration and programming (Bash, Python, Ruby \& \CPP).  By 2002 he got his pet project \acr{KT}urtle ---a zero-entry-barrier programming environment--- included in \acr{KDE}'s \emph{edu} module, and thereby in almost every Linux distribution.

% Extensively travelled Europe and Asia after graduating. On return his professional life became a mix of hands-on work in startups and web software agencies, while settling as a husband and father in personal life.

      \item Joined as a founding member of Data team
      \item Overhauled Street Search, which allowed users to find listings based on which street they were on, using Python to perform GIS analysis on every building in NYC to find what street(s) they were on, as well as identify every intersection in NYC
      \item Lead development Brokerage Similarity Score, which is an algorithm (built with scikit-learn) that finds the most similar brokerage based on the many factors including location, price, and number of their listings
      \item Built prototypes in Python and defined logic for the more complex portions of ingesting client and third party data, including finding off-market sales in public deeds records, creating \& updating buildings/units and their geometries from public assessments and parcels data for four different markets (NYC, Cincinnati, Iowa, California)
      \item Performed triage for client complaints, finding bugs, and working with engineers to implement fixes
      \item Built internal tools to automate manual processes, most notably creating or updating neighborhood/city geographies, and quarterly reporting for various clients
      \item Worked with Engineering and Customer Service teams to create metrics around data quality and customer satisfaction, as well as dashboards to track those metrics in Looker and Redash
      \item Gave presentations to the whole company, executives, and clients demonstrating new features and prototypes

      \item Worked with Data Science team to implement multi-classification models to identify gastroenterologists, general surgeons and their sub-specialties
      \item Led development on the Provider Cost Score, which is a risk-adjusted metric used to rank providers based on how well they manage costs of their procedures, by building a model in Python (using AWS Sagemaker) to find the expected cost of a medical episode while taking into account many risk factors related to the procedure, the provider, and their patient population%including type of episode, specialty and demographics of the provider, and the medical history of the patient and their demographics
      \item Developed new quality measures for medical procedures, and fixed bugs in previously built ones, in SAS using Medicare claims data
